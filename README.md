# Minecraft Item Generator

This project is a Minecraft item generator that simulates a slot machine to randomly select Minecraft items.

## Features

- Randomly generates Minecraft items.
- Displays confetti when an item is generated.

## Future Improvements

- Add the ability to filter the possible items that can be generated.
- Require a JSON file and a sprite sheet containing all obtainable items in survival mode.

## Note

This project is not fully finished. I would like to add the ability to filter the possible items that can be generated, but I need a JSON file and a sprite sheet with all the obtainable items in survival mode. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to create this.
